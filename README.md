Final project for David Mattia and John Riordan

To play Pong, begin by running main.py on student01.cse.nd.edu.
Then, run player1.py on any local machine (making sure pygame and twisted are installed).
If you want to play against a CPU, select that option in the menu and select the CPU difficulty.
If you want to play against someone else, have them run player2.py on their machine and select that option in the menu.

Move your pong paddle up and down using the up and down arrows.
The goal of the game is to make the ball hit the other person's side and not let it hit your own.
The game is played to 10 points, at which point the game will exit.
